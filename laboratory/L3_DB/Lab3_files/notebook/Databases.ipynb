    "# Laboratory Session 3 -- Databases \n",
    "\n",
    "On this laboratory session, you will be learning how to use databases and why they are very useful for data science or for supplying data for machine learning projects. The session will be divided into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relational databases:** you will install PGAdmin and Postgres and learn the basics of seting up a database, querying in SQL, and connecting your database to python to query directly. You will use the [mimic-iii database](https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-code), a critical care database.\n",
    "2. **Graph databases:** you will be introduced to a different type of databases. This will be done through Neo4j Sandbox. You will not have to install any software, as for this example you will work online. After querying the tool using the Cypher language, you will also try to query your Neo4j database through Python. You will be using the movies database, containing a series of movies, and its actors and directors."

    "## Databases - MIMIC III\n",
    "MIMIC-III is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients (**Note**: in this tutorial just a fraction will be used) who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. The database includes information such as demographics, vital sign measurements made at the bedside (~1 data point per hour), laboratory test results, procedures, medications, caregiver notes, imaging reports, and mortality (including post-hospital discharge).\n",
    "\n",
    "MIMIC supports a diverse range of analytic studies spanning epidemiology, clinical decision-rule improvement, and electronic tool development. It is notable for three factors: it is freely available to researchers worldwide; it encompasses a diverse and very large population of ICU patients; and it contains highly granular data, including vital signs, laboratory results, and medications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data description\n",
    "\n",
    "MIMIC-III is a relational database consisting of 26 tables. Tables are linked by identifiers which usually have the suffix ‘ID’. For example, SUBJECT_ID refers to a unique patient, HADM_ID refers to a unique admission to the hospital, and ICUSTAY_ID refers to a unique admission to an intensive care unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Charted events such as notes, laboratory tests, and fluid balance are stored in a series of ‘events’ tables. For example the OUTPUTEVENTS table contains all measurements related to output for a given patient, while the LABEVENTS table contains laboratory test results for a patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables prefixed with ‘D_’ are dictionary tables and provide definitions for identifiers. For example, every row of CHARTEVENTS is associated with a single ITEMID which represents the concept measured, but it does not contain the actual name of the measurement. By joining CHARTEVENTS and D_ITEMS on ITEMID, it is possible to identify the concept represented by a given ITEMID\n",
    "\n",
    "Tables composing the database:\n",
    "- admissions: Hospital admissions associated with an ICU stay\n",
    "- callout: Record of when patients were ready for discharge (called out), and the actual time of their discharge (or more generally, their outcome)\n",
