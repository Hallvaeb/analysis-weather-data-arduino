# Short Description
Part of this project was to collect weather data with an Arduino Uno, temperature sensors and luminance sensors. A linear regression model was then fitted using data from three days, where to goal of the model was to predict two hours of temperature and luminance data based on the first five. The results will both be a measure of model accuracy, and weather stability in the area.
